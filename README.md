# TTest_Correlation

This simple data cleaning and initial analysis, takes data from 4 sources
WIKIPEDIA for the various Metropolitan areas and the teams in the NFL,NBA,MLB and NHL in the area
Season statistics for the NBA, NFL,MLB,NHL
The aim was find the correlation between the NBA teams Win to Los Ratio for the various metropolitan areas and their population
An auxillary task included gathering information about the average WL Ratio for the various Metropolitan areas that
had different teams in different sports using a paired sample ttest. The values were put in a dataframe 

#The correlation statistic showed there was no significant correlation between the population and the average WL-Ratio.
A better analysis I feel would have been investigating the average attendance to these games by cities and their average WL-Ratio
This might build on the effect of fans on the outcomes on these games.
